# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## SYSC5108 Project

The number of customers who use credit cards has increased over the last decade. Credit cards are known for increasing the users' purchasing power and allowing them to meet their daily needs and much more. With the increased usage of credit cards, the number of credit card frauds has also increased dramatically. Credit card fraud is a serious criminal offense that costs consumers and fnancial organizations billions of dollars each year. As a result, fnancial institutions must be proactive about detecting and preventing these fraudulent activities. In this work, we explore the use of deep learning-based models for identifying these fraudulent transactions with acceptable performances. We use and compare machine learning techniques such as artifcial neural networks, automated machine learning, and semi-supervised learning approaches and provide recommendations on which techniques could be used effectively for this type of task.
